    "text = \"One of the main issues that degrowth in general is concerned with is inequality and its reduction (Hickel, 2021). Hence, distribution and the question of redistribution of wealth, income, and resources have continued to resurface in the degrowth literature (Cosme et al., 2017; Martinez-Alier, 2009; Spangenberg, 2010; Xue et al., 2012). Not so prominently discussed within degrowth, but no less relevant, is the question of money and its role in economic growth itself (see Fig. 1 in Kallis et al., 2018; Strunz et al., 2017). In particular, if money and the monetary system as such indeed fueled the need for economic growth, i.e., if a ‘monetary growth imperative’ existed, as some economists argue (e.g., Binswanger, 2013), analyses and proposals on how to design a monetary system better in line with the degrowth agenda would be much needed. Hence, given the immediate relevance of the monetary growth imperative for degrowth, one would expect that degrowth scholarship would feature the issue of money rather prominently. The same is true for the development of concrete policies addressing distributional issues or monetary system design. However, a lack of concrete policy proposals from the degrowth literature has been lamented repeatedly over the years in different contexts (Berg and Hukkinen, 2011; Bonaiuti, 2018; Demaria et al., 2013; Joutsenvirta, 2016; van den Bergh, 2011), and previous reviews of the degrowth literature have confirmed this on a general level to some extent (Cosme et al., 2017; Fitzpatrick et al., 2022; Sekulova et al., 2013; Videira et al., 2014). In particular, a wide variety of different kinds of goals, objectives, and instruments proposed in degrowth has been attested, as well as a ‘commonplace’ lack of precision in proposals (Fitzpatrick et al., 2022, p. 8). One possible explanation for this lack can be found in the relationship between degrowth and the state. Given the undertheorized role of the state as a central player in the degrowth transition (Demaria et al., 2019; D’Alisa and Kallis, 2020), degrowth faces “a tension between viewing the state as incapable of initiating transformational change and making a political appeal to it to do precisely this via targeted eco-social policies,” leaving “a lack in research on the strategic implications arising from conceptualizations of the state and state-civil society relations within degrowth/postgrowth approaches” (Koch, 2020 p. 1).\""
